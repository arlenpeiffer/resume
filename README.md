# resume

A simple resume builder React application made at the beginning of 2020 using [`Gatsby`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [`Emotion`](https://emotion.sh/) and [`Inter`](https://rsms.me/inter/).

## A few intentions

- 🚀 try out `Gatsby.js`
- 👩‍🎤 try out `Emotion` and compare to previous experience with `styled-components`
- ✍️ practice writing React hooks (`src/hooks/useDarkMode` and `src/hooks/useScreenWidth`)
- 💻 find a job

## A few instructions

```
# install dependencies
$ yarn

# then either
$ yarn dev

# or
$ yarn build
$ yarn start
```
